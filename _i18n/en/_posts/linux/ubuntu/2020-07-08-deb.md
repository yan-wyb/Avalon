The deb package is the system package format of the DEBIAN linux operating system and the package format installed by the APT source.

# Deb package management

## Install deb package

```shell
$ sudo dpkg -i ${filename}.deb
```
A small number of deb packages that do not need to be installed to the system folder do not require sudo permission to install.

example:

```shell
$ cd ${workspace}
$ wget https://github.com/yan-wyb/somethingelse/raw/master/tools/ubuntu18x64-scrt.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i ubuntu18x64-scrt.deb
```

There is an error that the dependency is not installed, which can be solved by the `APT` command.

```shell
$ sudo apt install -f
```

Or install deb through the `APT` command, which can solve the dependency problem at the same time.

```shell
$ sudo apt install ./ubuntu18x64-scrt.deb
```

## View installed packages

```shell
$ sudo dpkg -l
```

Usually this will print quite a lot of packets, it is best to filter through `grep`.

```shell
$ sudo dpkg -l | grep "${filename}"
```

example:

```shell
$ sudo dpkg -l | grep "scrt"
ii  scrt                                                        8.5.4-1942                                       amd64        SecureCRT
```

## Extract deb package source code

```shell
$ sudo dpkg -x ${filename}.deb ${filename}
```

The file in the `${filename}` file is the source code issue

example

```shell
$ cd ${workspace}
$ sudo dpkg -x ubuntu18x64-scrt.deb ubuntu18x64-scrt
$ ls ubuntu18x64-scrt
usr
```

## Extract DEBIAN compilation rules

```shell
$ sudo dpkg -e ${filename}.deb ${filename}/DEBIAN
```

example:

```shell
$ cd ${workspace}
$ sudo dpkg -e ubuntu18x64-scrt.deb ubuntu18x64-scrt/DEBIAN
$ ls ubuntu18x64-scrt/DEBIAN
conffiles  control
```

## Package deb package

```shell
$ sudo dpkg -b ${filename}
```

When packaging, you should confirm whether DEBIAN's compilation rules are included, that is, `${filename}/DEBIAN`

```shell
$ cd ${workspace}
$ rm ubuntu18x64-scrt.deb
$ ls
ubuntu18x64-scrt
$ sudo dpkg -b ubuntu18x64-scrt/
dpkg-deb: building package 'scrt' in 'ubuntu18x64-scrt.deb'.
$ ls 
ubuntu18x64-scrt  ubuntu18x64-scrt.deb
```
