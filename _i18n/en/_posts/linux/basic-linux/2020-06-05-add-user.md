New ordinary users with super permissions in Linux

# Switch root

The new user needs a lot of permissions to set up some things, here switch to the `root` user to do the processing

```shell
$ su
```

# New home directory

The location of the new main directory is generally created under the `home/` directory, and there is also a choice of the `usr` directory

```shell
root# mkdir /home/[USER]  /*The home directory is set under `/home/`*/
root# mkdir /usr/[USER]   /*The main directory is set under `/usr/`*/
```

# Added `group` and `user`

New user group and users under the group

```shell
root# groupadd [group]
root# useradd -d /home/[user] -g [group] -s /bin/bash [user]
```

It is recommended that `group` and `user` use the same name. If you have a new multi-user requirement, you can set different names

# Increase sudo permissions

The configuration file for super permissions is `/etc/sudoers`, this is a read-only file for all users, you need to add write permissions first, and restore permissions after changing

```shell
root# chmod +w /etc/sudoers
root# vim /etc/
```

Add a line below root

```shell
# User privilege specification
root	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

change into:

```
# User privilege specification
root	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
[user]  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

Remove write permission after modification

```shell
root# chmod -w /etc/sudoers
```

# Modify home directory permissions and affiliation

Modify the user group to which the home directory belongs

```shell
root# chown -R [group].[user] /home/[user] /*The home directory is set under `/home/`*/
root# chown -R [group].[user] /usr/[user]  /*The main directory is set under `/usr/`*/
```

Modify home directory permissions

```shell
root# chmod -R 755 /home/[user] /*The home directory is set under `/home/`*/
root# chmod -R 755 /usr/[user]  /*The main directory is set under `/usr/`*/
```

# Set user password

```shell
root# passwd [user]
```

At this point, all the settings are complete. You can switch to your new user through the `su [user]` command
