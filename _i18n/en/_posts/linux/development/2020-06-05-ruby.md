Install `ruby` through `RVM`, you can install multiple versions of `ruby`, and the compatibility is better.

## Install rvm

### Install dependent tools

`rvm` depends on `gnupg2`, first of all, we must ensure that `GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)` is the latest version, in order to obtain the correct private key through the public key.

```shell
$ sudo apt install gnupg2
```

### Key signing RVM version

We are going to sign each RVM version with the key of the RVM project. Having the public key of the RVM project allows us to verify the legitimacy of the RVM version we will download, which is signed with a matching private key

```shell
$ gpg2 --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
```

### Get rvm installation script

Now download the latest rvm installation script via `curl`.

```shell
$ cd ${workspace}
$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io -o rvm.sh
```

### Install rvm

Now execute the script through the shell and install rvm

```shell
$ cd ${workapace}
$ cat rvm.sh | bash -s stable --rails
```

This process needs to wait for a long time, and because the server is in a foreign country, those without "scientific Internet access" are generally very slow, and even need to abort the installation process and reload.
Fortunately, use `curl -sSL` to interrupt re-execution, the previously downloaded part will be retained, and then download, instead of re-downloading.

## Install ruby

After rvm is installed, the latest ruby version will be installed by default. At this time, you can choose the ruby version you need to install.

### source rvm


```shell
$ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```

### View `ruby` version

View installable `ruby` version.

```shell
$ rvm list known
```

View installed `ruby` version.

```shell
$ rvm list
```

### Install and switch versions

Install different `ruby` versions

```shell
$ rvm install ruby_version /*`ruby_version` format is `ruby-x.x.x` or `x.x.x`*/
```

Switch the version you need `ruby`

```shell
$ rvm use ruby_version /*`ruby_version` format is `ruby-x.x.x` or `x.x.x`*/
```

### Uninstall and reinstall

`uninstall`和`reinstall`

```shell
$ rvm uninstall ruby_version /*`ruby_version` format is `ruby-x.x.x` or `x.x.x`*/
$ rvm reinstall ruby_version /*`ruby_version` format is `ruby-x.x.x` or `x.x.x`*/
```

## bundler

`bundler` is a very important `ruby` package, which can ensure that all packages that the application depends on and dependencies of dependent packages are installed.

### Install bundler

```
$ gem install bundler
```

### How to Use bundler

Declare dependencies in `Gemfile` and run in the application directory:

```shell
$ bundle install
```

bundler will automatically install these packages and dependencies of these packages.

## Change source of `ruby` and `bundler`

The server of `ruby` is abroad, the access in China is extremely slow, and it can’t even be accessed at all, the solution is to change the source to a domestic source

`ruby` change source

```shell
$ gem sources --add https://gems.ruby-china.com/ --remove https://rubygems.org/
```

`bundler` change source

```shell
$ bundle config mirror.https://rubygems.org https://gems.ruby-china.com
```
