# regex error

* erro info: 

```shell
Unescaped left brace in regex is illegal here in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/\${ <-- HERE ([^ \t=:+{}]+)}/ at ...
```

* Solution:

edit `automake`

```shell
$ vim /path/to/automake
```

```shell
$text =~ s/\${([^ \t=:+{}]+)}/substitute_ac_subst_variables_worker ($1)/ge;
```

change to:

```shell
$text =~ s/\$\{([^ \t=:+\{\}]+)\}/substitute_ac_subst_variables_worker ($1)/ge;
```
