ssh is an important tool for linux remote operation and management services

# Install ssh

Just use the package installation work of each distribution to install it directly. Here, take the APT source as an example

```shell
$ sudo apt install ssh
```

# ssh common commands

## ssh connect to remote host

Using ssh to log in to the server or other hosts on the LAN is a very common method, especially in embedded development.

```shell
$ ssh host-usename@host-ipaddress
```

example:

```shell
$ ssh root@192.168.1.250
```

## Quit remote connection

Use the `exit` command to exit the remote connection.

```shell
$ exit
```

## ssh copy file

`scp` is the most commonly used tool to interact with data remotely, the `-r` parameter can directly interact with the entire folder

```shell
$ scp [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2
$ scp -r [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2

```

host1 is the copy location, host2 is the target location. Then copy the file to the remote host, host1 is your host, and host2 is the remote host. Copy the file from the remote host to the local reverse. For example:

```shell
$ scp ~/ssh.txt root@10.72.1.16:~  #Copy from local to remote host
$ scp root@10.72.1.16:~/ssh.txt ~  #Copy from remote host to local
```



# ssh key

## Generate ssh key

The `ssh key` can be generated directly from the terminal through the ssh command under `linux`

```shell
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "you@email.com"
```

Select the default option to generate the corresponding key

## View the generated key

```shell
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

## Add to ssh-agent

ssh-agent is the key manager, which is mainly used to manage the private key used for public key verification.

```shell
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```


# Git uses ssh

Taking github as an example, gitlab and gitee are the same

## Add key to github

Open github page, open settings

![ssh-git-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/miscellaneous/ssh-git-1.png)

Find `SSH Key` in the left column

![ssh-git-2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/miscellaneous/ssh-git-2.png)

Then on the main interface there is a button to add `ssh key`

![ssh-git-3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/miscellaneous/ssh-git-3.png)

Add the generated SSH Key to the key, titile can be set at will

![ssh-git-4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/miscellaneous/ssh-git-4.png)

`Add SSH Key` will be added later

## Test whether Git's ssh configuration is successful

```shell
$ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi yan-wyb! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

See this name configuration has been successful.
Afterwards, use ssh to clone and push the code, so there is no need to enter a password.

```shell
$ git@github.com:khadas/khadas_docs.git
```

**note**: The one that starts with `git@` uses the ssh method `clone`, and the one that starts with `https://` uses the `https://` method


# ssh password-free login

`client`: Refers to the side that uses id_rsa` for ssh login, often for the PC side where you are operating the remote login, or the deployment tool side, such as `travis`

`server`: The value accepts `id_rsa.pub` and saves it into the `authorized_keys` side, often a server such as Alibaba Cloud or github.

**note**: Secret-free login is extremely sensitive to permissions

## Client operation

First generate a pair of secret keys, the generation method can refer to the above `ssh key`, set permissions for the key pair

```shell
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Add the public key to the server's authorization file

```shell
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@xx.x.xx.x  /*1. The public key can be customized; 2.user is the server user name; 3.xx.x.xx.x is the server address, and the domain name can also be used*/
```


Enter the password for remote login, it is added successfully

## Serve operation

The server only needs to set permissions

```shell
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## test

The client logs in using `ssh`

```
$ ssh user@xx.x.xx.x
```

Direct login means that the setting is successful, you need to enter the password should check the permissions problem. The home directory permissions must be less than or equal to `755`
