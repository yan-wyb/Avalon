Configure to use the open source ssl certificate `Let's Encrypt` of the Linux Foundation

1. Let's Encrypt certificate is not only free, but also supports wildcard certificate (wildcard certificate refers to a public key certificate that can be used by multiple subdomains), multiple subdomains are very convenient to use.
2. It can be directly obtained through the script of the source code, and the application process is very simple.
3. The certificate is valid for 90 days and can be updated directly through the script

## Server settings

Take Alibaba Cloud as an example, other servers are configured in the same way

### 433 port settings


Log in to the server console and confirm that the 433 port is open in the security group of the instance, and there is no need to add a rule

### Domain name resolution settings

A resolution record is required for the domain name, so that the application tool can access it through the domain name to confirm the domain name

![domain name]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/miscellaneous/ssl-domain-name.png)

1. Select the record type, generally select `A`, point to `ipv4` address, if you are using `ipv6 address`, select `AAAA`, domain name redirection, select `CNAME`.
2. Host record, choose `www` or `@` or whatever. Here you need to remember your host record, which will be used later.
3. Your domain name
4. Record value select the IP address you want to resolve
5. Use the default value for TTL.

### Server port processing

When the script generates the SSL certificate, it needs to use the `80` and `433` ports, to ensure that the port is not occupied

```shell
$ sudo netstat -ntlp
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      623/nginx: master p 
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.53:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      467/systemd-resolve 
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      572/sshd            
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      623/nginx: master p 

```

Use the kill command to end the process using the `80` and `433` ports

```shell
$ sudo kill [PID]
```

At this point, the preparation of the server is completed

## Apply for a certificate

### Get script file

The script is open source on github, clone the repository to the local through `git`

```shell
$ cd ${workspace}
$ git clone https://github.com/certbot/certbot
$ cd certbot
```

### Generate certificate

```shell
$ ./certbot-auto certonly --webroot --agree-tos -v -t --email ${email} -w ${website root} -d ${domain name}
```

1. `${email}` Fill in your email address here, it is recommended to keep the same as the email address of the server application account
2. `${website root}` Your website source directory
3. `${domain name}` When resolving the domain name above, the resolution domain name you set, if the host record sets `www`, it should be `www.{domain name}`, if you set `@`, just fill in the domain name directly

If you have no problem with the above settings, then here, the problem should be successfully generated certificate

```shell
root# ls /etc/letsencrypt/live/`${domain name}`/
cert.pem       chain.pem      fullchain.pem  privkey.pem    README
```

### Generate dhparams

dhparams ensures that both parties can exchange keys securely

```shell
$ openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparams.pem 2048
```

## Configure


After preparing the integer, it must be configured into the deployment tool.Here is an example of `nginx`

```shell
server {
       listen 80;
       server_name ${domain name} www.${domain name};
       return 301 ${domain name}$request_uri;
}

server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name ${domain name} www.${domain name};
       ssl on;
       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/${domain name}/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/${domain name}/privkey.pem;
       ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparams.pem;
       ssl_protocols SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
       ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
       location / {
              root ${website root};
              index index.html index.htm;
       }
}

```

Just restart nginx service
